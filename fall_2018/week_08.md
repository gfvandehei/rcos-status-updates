Last Week: 
 - This will be short and sweet, I did nothing. Thanksgiving and work from other classes over thanksgiving took up most of my time
 
 This Week:
 - Same as the last status update, non of the goals from last week were met
 - Would like to add options to move around in pages
 - Improve UI of mainpage
 - Add the logo to the mainpage so it is less of a template and more functional
 - Maybe add some user authentication, so we can display user customized news feeds
