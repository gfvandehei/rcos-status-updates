#Last Week:
- worked on styling of blog posts placed on site
- messed with styling related to the resizing of screens
- moved from just throwing data into a div to a multi flexbox organization
- added article image support

This week was really focused on getting the blogs to both look and function nicely on the homepage, the homepage was somewhat bland, but now pictures from the blogs show adding a little color
#This week:
- Polish the front end, make it look pretty
- continue working on resizing and formatting of posts
- merge my changes with nick's

Next week I will be focusing on polishing a demo for the presentation of out project
